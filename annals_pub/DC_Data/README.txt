This folder normally houses David Cunningham's data on the number of klaverns in each location.
We do not own this data and will not distribute it the results of our tests with this data are here
in the KLAVERNS_tests.smcl. 

In the future we may re-add David's data as "klan_presence.sav" with permission. You will notice the FullMerge.do file in the annal_pub folder create the KLAVERNS_tests.smcl log file, that part has been commented out to prevent error if users try to rebuild our dataset.
